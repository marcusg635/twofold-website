            Our pricing is unusual. Our coverage model is different. Instead of hoping you don’t notice, we’d
            rather explain it up front.

              We base our prices on volume and real expenses instead of trying to make the most from a small number
              of weddings. We work across multiple states and book more often, which lets us keep each package more
              reasonable while still paying our team fairly.
              <br><br>
              Our prices aren’t low because the quality is low. They’re low because the structure is different.
              That’s rare, and we’re not hiding that.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              It’s fair to feel that way. Many couples have seen cheap offers go badly, so they expect a catch.
              We’re rare in that we keep pricing accessible and still deliver real work from real weddings.
              <br><br>
              We’re always open to phone calls or video calls so you can talk to a real person, ask direct
              questions, and see if you feel comfortable. We also work with reputable wedding venues who are happy
              to vouch for us and confirm that we show up and do the work.
              <br><br>
              You can watch full wedding films and view photo examples on this site so you don’t have to imagine
              what you’re getting.

              <span class="faq-question">Who actually shoots my wedding.</span>

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              The honest answer is that we usually don’t lock in the exact shooter until closer to the wedding,
              often around a month out. Our partner photographers and videographers also run their own businesses,
              so they first confirm their regular clients and then let us know what dates remain open.
              <br><br>
              Waiting to assign a shooter lets us see who’s available and secure that person at a rate that keeps
              your pricing lower. They’re still paid fairly, and tipping your photographer and videographer on the
              day is always appreciated.
              <br><br>
              Most important, we guarantee that your wedding will be covered. The fact that we work as a network
              instead of one person is part of how we can promise coverage. If one person is sick or has an
              emergency, there’s someone else to step in. You’re not depending on a single individual.

              Marcus, the owner, is born and raised in Iowa and has family there. He now lives in Florida and also
              has family in the South. Because of that, we spend time in both regions and build schedules around
              travel between them.
              <br><br>
              We focus on all of Iowa, plus southern Georgia and northern Florida as no travel fee zones. Other
              states are possible with added travel and lodging costs, which are included in the quote so you know
              what to expect before booking.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              We often book two or three weddings per weekend, depending on partner availability and location.
              Because we work with multiple people and not just one, this can be done without sacrificing
              coverage. Each wedding is assigned its own photographer and or videographer so you’re not sharing a
              person with another couple on the same day.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              No. Most of the time we have couples pay in full at booking. Our prices are already lower than many
              retainers that other companies charge just to hold a date. Paying in full lets us book travel early,
              which keeps costs down.
              <br><br>
              Because of this structure, we don’t give refunds if you decide not to move forward, including in
              cases of breakup or change of mind. The only time refunds are considered is if we fail to provide
              coverage as agreed and decide that a refund is the right answer.
              <br><br>
              If the wedding is cancelled, we allow you to gift your coverage to another couple or another event on any
              open date with no extra charge, as long as travel and location remain realistic for us.
              <br><br>
              We’ve never failed to provide coverage for a booked wedding and we don’t plan on starting now.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              We focus on full day coverage. Because we often travel and build our calendar around complete
              wedding days, it doesn’t make sense for us to come for only a short window.
              <br><br>
              We can adjust details like how many final videos you receive or how many photos are edited, but the
              main structure is full day coverage so you’re not worried about when the clock stops.

              The booking agreement covers payment, travel, what’s included, and how delivery works. You can read
