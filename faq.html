            Our pricing is unusual and our coverage model is different. Instead of hoping you don't notice, we'd rather explain it up front.

              We base our prices on volume and real expenses instead of trying to make the most from a small number
              of weddings. We work across multiple states and book more often, which lets us keep each package more
              reasonable while still paying our team fairly.
              <br><br>
              Our prices aren't low because the quality is low. They're low because the structure is different. That's rare, and we're not hiding it.

              It's fair to feel that way. Many couples have seen cheap offers go badly, so they expect a catch.
              We're different in that we keep pricing accessible and still deliver real work from real weddings.
              <br><br>
              We're always open to phone calls or video calls so you can talk to a real person, ask direct
              questions, and see if you feel comfortable. We also work with reputable wedding venues who are happy to vouch for us and confirm that we show up and do the work.

              You can watch full wedding films and view photo examples on this site so you don't have to imagine what you're getting.

              Marcus, the owner, personally films approximately 90% of our weddings. In the event that Marcus isn't available for your date, we may bring in a reputable third-party videographer whom we've vetted and trust to uphold our standards.
              <br><br>
              Regardless of who is behind the camera, all editing and post-production is handled entirely in-house by our team, ensuring a consistent look and quality across every film we deliver.
              <br><br>
              Most importantly, we guarantee that your wedding will be covered. If one person has a scheduling conflict or emergency, there's someone else to step in. You're not depending on a single individual.

              We typically don't lock in the exact photographer until closer to the wedding,
              often around a month out. Our partner photographers also run their own businesses,
              so they first confirm their regular clients and then let us know what dates remain open.
              <br><br>
              Waiting to assign a photographer lets us see who's available and secure that person at a rate that keeps
              your pricing lower. They're still paid fairly, and tipping your photographer on the
              day is always appreciated.
              <br><br>
              Most importantly, we guarantee that your wedding will be covered. The fact that we work as a network
              instead of one person is part of how we can promise coverage. If one person is sick or has an
              emergency, there's someone else to step in. You're not depending on a single individual.

              Marcus, the owner, is born and raised in Iowa and has family there. He now lives in Florida and also
              has family in the South. Because of that, we spend time in both regions and build schedules around
              travel between them.
              <br><br>
              We focus on all of Iowa, plus southern Georgia and northern Florida as no-travel-fee zones. Other
              states are possible with added travel and lodging costs, which are included in the quote so you know
              what to expect before booking.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              We often book multiple weddings per weekend, depending on partner availability and location.
              Because we work with multiple people and not just one, this can be done without sacrificing
              coverage. Each wedding is assigned its own photographer and/or videographer so you're not sharing a
              person with another couple on the same day.

            </button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              No. We typically have couples pay in full at booking. Our prices are already lower than many
              retainers that other companies charge just to hold a date. Paying in full lets us book travel early,
              which keeps costs down.
              <br><br>
              Because of this structure, we don't offer refunds if you decide not to move forward, including in
              cases of breakup or change of mind. Refunds are only considered if we fail to provide
              coverage as agreed and decide that a refund is the right answer.
              <br><br>
              If the wedding is cancelled, we allow you to gift your coverage to another couple or another event on any
              open date with no extra charge, as long as travel and location remain realistic for us.
              <br><br>
              We've never failed to provide coverage for a booked wedding, and we don't plan on starting now.

            <div class="faq-answer">
              We focus on full-day coverage. Because we often travel and build our calendar around complete
              wedding days, it doesn't make sense for us to travel for only a short window.
              <br><br>
              We can adjust details like how many final videos you receive or how many photos are edited, but the
              main structure is full-day coverage so you're never worried about the clock.
