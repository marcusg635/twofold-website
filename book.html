          <p class="section-sub">
            Booking with TwoFold Visuals is straightforward. You don’t need a full timeline or shot list yet. We only
            need the basics to confirm that we’re a good fit and that your date is open.

          <div class="card">
            <h3>Step one. Reach out.</h3>
            <p>
              Use the contact page to send your names, wedding date, contact details, ceremony and reception
              locations if you know them, and what you’re looking for: photo, video, or both. If you don’t have a
              venue yet, that’s fine. You can send it later.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Step two. Talk through details.</h3>
            <p>
              We confirm if your date is open and share today’s pricing for your location and what you want
              booked. If you want to talk live, we can set up a call or video chat to walk through anything that
              feels unclear.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="card">
            <h3>Step three. Booking agreement and payment.</h3>
            <p>
              When you’re ready, you complete the booking agreement and pay in full. Because our pricing is lower
              than many retainers at other companies, payment in full lets us secure travel early and keep costs
              down.

          <h2 class="section-title">Timeline planning comes later.</h2>
          <p class="section-sub">
            You don’t need a finished timeline to book with us. Once the date is secured, Kelly can help you build
            a realistic timeline closer to the wedding day so your photo and video coverage match what you’re
            actually planning.
