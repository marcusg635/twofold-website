            This page is a plain language summary of how booking with TwoFold Visuals works. The exact contract you
            sign may include additional details, but the core ideas are the same as what you see here.

      <section>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Payment and booking.</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Your date is reserved once the booking agreement is signed and payment in full is received.</li>
            <li>We do not use a small retainer plus a later balance. Payment in full keeps our pricing low and lets
              us book travel early.</li>
            <li>Because we may turn away other couples for your date, payments are not refunded if you cancel or choose not to move forward.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Refunds and gifting your coverage.</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>If you cancel for any reason, including breakup or change of plans, payments are not refunded.</li>
            <li>In rare cases where you have a major emergency, we may consider a partial or full refund, but it is not guaranteed. In many cases we have already used part of the funds to book flights or travel that cannot be refunded.</li>
            <li>If we fail to provide coverage as agreed and do not supply a replacement, we will issue a refund within
              30 days.</li>
            <li>If your wedding is cancelled, you may gift your coverage to another couple or another event on any
              open date with no extra charge, as long as travel and location remain realistic for us.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Coverage length.</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Our pricing is built on full day coverage. This usually means from getting ready through the main
              reception events.</li>
            <li>We do not offer tiny hour block coverage at deep discounts, because travel and time costs are the
              same whether we are there for a few hours or most of the day.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Travel and locations.</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>No travel fees for weddings in all of Iowa plus southern Georgia and northern Florida.</li>
            <li>Other locations may include added travel and lodging costs, which are included in your quote and
              agreed to before booking.</li>
            <li>If travel costs change in a major way after booking, we communicate and work toward a reasonable
              solution instead of surprising you later.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Timeline and planning.</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>We do not need a full timeline at the time of booking.</li>
            <li>Closer to the wedding, Kelly works with you to build a realistic timeline for photos and video so
              the day runs smoothly.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Delivery.</h3>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Delivery times for photos and video are stated in the signed agreement.</li>
            <li>We aim to deliver within about 30 days whenever our schedule allows. During very busy stretches,
              delivery can take longer, but you will know the expected time frame when you book.</li>
            <li>Galleries and films are delivered digitally so you can download, back up, and share them.</li>
